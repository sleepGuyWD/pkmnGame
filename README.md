# pkmnGame
Welcome to the PkmnGame repository! This project was born out of my passion for Pokémon and my desire to expand my JavaScript skill set. It's a Pokémon-styled game where you can move a character around an island, exploring the landscape.

## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** HTML, JavaScript, Tiled

The development process for PkmnGame involved an 8-hour tutorial, during which I had the opportunity to deeply analyze the code and relate it to my current understanding of JavaScript.

The game interface is designed with HTML and Tiled, an open-source map editor. JavaScript is used to bring our character to life, allowing it to interact with the environment in a dynamic way.

## Lessons Learned:
Throughout the creation of PkmnGame, I learned just how extensive JavaScript can be. One of the most crucial lessons was understanding how to optimize my code base, which I feel will significantly contribute to my future projects. This project has been a fantastic platform to stretch my coding skills and step outside my comfort zone.

## Future Improvements:
Currently, the primary function of the game is exploration. The player can roam around the island, immersing themselves in the Pokémon-themed environment. In the future, I may consider implementing a battling function to expand the gameplay experience. However, the initial aim was to create a captivating environment and ensure a smooth character movement throughout the island. Please stay tuned for future updates!
